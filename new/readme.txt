This is a snapshot of the version of datavstime i'm currently working on.

The primary change is Facebook's Flux has been swapped out in favour of Redux. Also, 
I've been working on some performance optimizations that this enables.

This version is not yet as functionally complete as the main version, but it shouldn't
take too long to get there - i've broken the back of it.

I've also moved from JSPM to webpack.
